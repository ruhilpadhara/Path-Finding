# Path-finding
Example shown in pygame of pathfinding using the A* algorithm and dynamic path following.

With pygame installed, run main
Make any tile a wall tile by holding left click on it
Revert any wall tiles by holding right click on it

Once all walls are placed, press any key to start the pathfinding process
A* will look for a path starting at the left yellow tile and ending at the right yellow tile

If a path is found, a red line will be drawn using a Dynamic movement path follow algorithm
If a path is not found, the starting and ending tiles will turn red

After path has completed, press any key to restart the entire process
